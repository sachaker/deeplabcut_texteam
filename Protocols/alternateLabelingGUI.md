### Accurately labeling 40 nodes in a matter of seconds

Our DLC labeling process is laborious and repetitive. This alternative to DeepLabCut's point-and-click labeling allows for rapid labeling of contiguous structures, such as whiskers. In this new system, the user drags the cursor along each structure, after which nodes of a set number are generated automatically in equal increments along the path.
